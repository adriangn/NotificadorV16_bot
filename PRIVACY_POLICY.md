# Privacy Policy (NotificadorV16_bot)

**Last updated:** 2026-01-12

## 1) Controller

This bot (“NotificadorV16_bot”) allows Telegram chats to manage municipality subscriptions and receive notifications about active V16 beacons based on public information published by the Spanish traffic authority (DGT).

## 2) Data we process

To provide the service, the bot may process:

- **Telegram chat identifier (`chat_id`)**: required to store subscriptions and send messages.
- **Subscriptions**: the municipalities a chat is subscribed to.
- **Preferences**: “quiet mode” settings (time window or continuous pause).
- **Technical data**: operational logs and metrics related to service reliability and security (e.g., errors, counters).

The bot does **not** request or need your name, phone number, email, precise device location, or the content of your conversations, beyond the commands/messages needed to operate the service.

## 3) Purpose of processing

We process data only to:

- Manage your **subscriptions**.
- Apply your **preferences** (e.g., quiet mode).
- Send you **service notifications**.
- Maintain **security and reliability** (monitoring, troubleshooting, abuse prevention).

## 4) Legal basis

The legal basis is your **consent** and the **legitimate interest** of providing the requested service and ensuring its security and operation.

## 5) Data retention

- **Subscriptions and preferences** are kept while the chat uses the service or until you remove them.
- **Logs** are retained for **90 days**.
- Operational anti-duplication markers and other service data may have shorter retention windows (hours/days) to prevent repeated notifications and ensure continuity.

## 6) Sharing and third parties

- **Telegram**: as the messaging platform, it processes messages under its own policies.
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: infrastructure where the bot runs and stores operational data (e.g., database and logs).
- Incident data is fetched from the **public DGT feed**.

We do not sell personal data or share it with third parties for marketing purposes.

## 7) Security

We apply reasonable security measures (access controls, secret separation, webhook validation, and monitoring). However, no system is 100% secure.

## 8) Your rights and how to contact us

You can:

- Remove subscriptions using the bot commands.
- Request deletion of data associated with your chat (subscriptions and preferences).

To do so, contact the bot maintainer and include your `chat_id`.

## 9) Changes to this policy

We may update this policy to reflect technical or legal changes. The “Last updated” date indicates the current version.
